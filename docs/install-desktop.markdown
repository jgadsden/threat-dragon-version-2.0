## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

[Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) comes in two variants, 
desktop application and web application.

### Desktop application install instructions
Installable versions are available for download from the [OWASP GitHub area](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-desktop/releases):

* Windows (64 bit) installer
* MacOS installer
* Linux snap, AppImage, debian and rpm installers

The current versions of the desktop application are not code-signed, so:
* you could get a warning when installed on Windows platforms
* you may have to make a MacOS exception when running on Apple platforms
