Downloading the desktop app

The following installable versions are available for download from GitHub:

* Windows (64 bit)
* MacOS
* Linux

 The current versions of the desktop application are not code-signed.
 This means you could get a warning when you try to install it on Windows.
 It also means that the application will not auto-update on any of the platforms.
 This will be fixed in a future release.
