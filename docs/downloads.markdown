## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

[Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) comes in two variants, 
desktop application and web application.

### Desktop application
Installable versions are available for download from the
[OWASP GitHub area](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-desktop/releases):

* Windows (64 bit) installer
* MacOS installer
* Linux snap, AppImage, debian and rpm installers

The current versions of the desktop application are not code-signed, so:
* you could get a warning when installed on Windows platforms
* you may have to make a MacOS exception when running on Apple platforms

See the detailed [install instructions](/install-webapp/) for these work arounds.

### Web application
The web application can be run locally or from a server, and is downloaded from the 
[Threat Dragon repo](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/releases).
There is some configuration necessary, so see the
[install instructions](/install-webapp/) for configuring the application.
