## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

[Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) comes in two variants, 
desktop application and webb appliccation.

### Downloading and installing the desktop app

Installable versions are available for download from GitHub:

* Windows (64 bit) installer
* MacOS installer
* Linux snap, AppImage, debian and rpm installers

The current versions of the desktop application are not code-signed, so:
* you could get a warning when installed on Windows platforms
* the application will not auto-update, though this may be fixed in later versions

### Downloading and running the web app
